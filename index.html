     <p>I slowly open my eyes, only to see a starry, dark blue sky above me. <br>
	For some reason, I'm lying flat on my back, and I have no idea how I got here. <br>
	I stare at the sky a little bit longer, without giving much care to anything else around me. <br>
	"How peaceful...", I thought. <br>
	"When was the last time I've gone outside and enjoyed nature like this?" <br>
	"I really should do this more often, but I always seem to go back on my word." <br>
	"Whatever, I guess I'll just look around for now." <br>
